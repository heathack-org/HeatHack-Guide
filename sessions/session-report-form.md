# Session Report Form

After the session, the group leader fills out a very brief report form that gives us evidence that the session happened for our funders and lets us know what you need from us.
Please do fill it out.

Please feel free to contact us about anything you wish - for us that's the interesting part about running the programme.  We're happy to discuss details of your building and your plans, and are especially interested in the problems you face, since we can discuss these with grant funders and professionals.
