# Engineer Talks

In the talks, the engineer explains basic concepts to the group.  They're very short and simple. 

- First talk: Making people comfortable
- Second talk: How do we know what actions are right for us?
- Third talk: Getting the heating under control

We give simple, non-technical bullet points for the talks in the session schedules.  You can find more background to support the core concepts the talks convey in the "Background information" section of this guide.

[](practical-reading)

Most engineers just use the bullet points, although they sometimes stick in interesting bits from the practical reading, especially, if the group members are all happy with a little more technical detail.  Engineers often illustrate the points by pointing to things in the room or talking about features in other parts of the building.  A few engineers use Powerpoint slides or draw a picture on the flip-chart and add things to it as they go.

If you would like more support to give the talks, please ask - we'll be happy to provide what you need.

This week's engineer talk lays out some basic concepts that it is important for the group to understand, because they affect which of two major paths a community building might take in future.  The talk is about why we heat buildings, and especially, what makes people feel comfortable.  After a discussion with our first set of engineers, we provide simple bullet points for the talk, a memory aid list of the six elements of thermal comfort, and a few details that could be useful.  

 We can write up just a bit more further information with technical links as required, for instance, see

- [Thermal Comfort](thermal-comfort)

## Bullet points

- We heat buildings mostly to make people comfortable

- Thermal comfort isn’t just about air temperature!

- If you’re surrounded by cold surfaces, they take heat from you

- Some materials warm up (and cool down) quickly when you turn the heating on.  Stone does not.

- Problem:  how do you make a stone building feel warm if it doesn’t make sense to heat it because it’s mostly empty?  

- **Make** it make sense to heat it – by finding a good reason to use the building more

- Put something very warm not too far from the people (like an infrared panel)

- Put something gently warm right up against them (like heated seating or underfloor heating - or cats)

- Thermal comfort is about more air temperature and the surrounding surfaces

- Deal with the draughts

- Make sure the building isn’t damp – vent out moist air from people breathing in there, and mind that roof!

- Make sure the temperature doesn’t keep changing so they don’t have to keep taking clothes on and off

- Know who’s running around and who’s not

- What about the building?  Take advice – if they aren’t damp, some of them will be just fine.  Others need a minimum temperature kept.

## Slightly more detailed and techier "script" version - 

Heating is the biggest use of energy in a community building, so the first thing we need think about it why we heat buildings.  The main reason is to make people comfortable.

Air temperature is important to comfort, but people are fairly adaptable, as long as the air temperature doesn't vary more than around 2C.  Temperature swings make them uncomfortable even if the temperatures are "right", because they need to continually adjust their clothing.  

Air temperature is only one of six things that affect their thermal comfort.  The average temperature of the surfaces around them - the "mean radiant temperature" - is just as important.  Windows are always a bit cold especially if they're single glazed.

Surfaces in stone buildings especially take a long time to warm up because stone has high "thermal mass", and that makes them uncomfortable and expensive to heat for occasional use.  Modern materials might quickly come to match the air temperature but stone does not.  There are two ways out of this 

- use the building more (since each use gets more comfortable for the same energy in) 
- don't bother trying to heat the building, just heat the people either by putting something very warm near them (e.g., infrared panel) or putting something gently warm right up against them (heated seating, hot water bottle, low underfloor heating)


The other four things that affect thermal comfort:

- draughts - can be cheap to address, but very often get overlooked!
- humidity - one of the most critical things you can do to make a building comfortable is make sure it is watertight so it doesn't get damp. 
- metabolic rate - mostly, how active the people are
- clothing levels 

Second reason to heat buildings:  building preservation.  

- How much heating is required depends on the building, situation, and what the building contains.
- The experts don't agree what's actually required and it tends to depend on energy prices - some conservationists are beginning to say that some older buildings don't need heating at all.
- Damp is the enemy, and heating isn't the main solution - keep the building water-tight and well-ventilated especially after people have been in.
- Common recommendation: a minimum "set back" temperature at which the heating will come on gently (much better than heating the building a couple of hours a day for good luck)

   - some sources say 7-8C for stone churches, 
   - some architects specify on the building plans 
   - conservationists have specific recommendations for oil paintings and so on.

Thing to think about: what's our strategy for heating the building?


<!-- :TODO: need to say something in the materials about not letting lots of warm air into a cold stone building because there will then be condensation on the inside - but there really isn't time for this kind of detail! -->

<!-- session 2
Payback is too slow for heat loss mitigations on a building you don't use often, and it's hard to get grants and donations for infrequently used buildings because the community amenity is less.
-->

<!-- too much detail; insulation is for session 2

Stone buildings are excellent at damping down the extremes in outside temperature - making it cooler inside during the day/in the spring and warmer inside at night/in the autumn than it would be in a more reactive building - but they are extremely difficult to make warm for a short time.  On the other hand, once the stones are warm, they cool down slowly.  They also are more expensive and more difficult to retrofit with heat loss mitigations, with some uncertainty about what's safe to do but also many useful case studies that show techniques that work. The key is ventilation and breatheability - it's critical not to let moisture get trapped in the building.
