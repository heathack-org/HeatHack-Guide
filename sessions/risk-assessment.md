# Risk assessment






The first activity that might take the group into non-public areas is when they talk about how to take energy meter readings.  The risk assessment comes before this and should be led by the engineer.   During the risk assessment, you identify the hazards you may encounter and agree what to do about them to reduce the risks they present. We have put some common hazards into a simple risk assessment template based on one from the Health and Safety Executive.  You need to consider them, but also add any others you can think of.

For some groups, this will be the first time they have ever completed a risk assessment.  Others will already have completed good risk assessments that apply to all areas of their buildings.  It's still worth discussing the risk assessment with the group to make it fresh in their minds and to reinforce our ground rules: don't go alone, no ladders, and no unsafe steps.
