**Create a draught lobby**

Keep warm air from exiting the building by putting two doors between the outside and the first proper room and donâ€™t open them at the same time.  Draught lobbies can be either inside the building or tacked on the outside.  Often they are made in glass to avoid the building becoming less welcoming and incorporate automatic doors to save energy and make the building more accessible.
