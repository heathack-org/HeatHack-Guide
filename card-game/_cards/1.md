**Maintain buildings and keep them dry**

Major repairs have huge carbon and financial costs.  Damp also makes a building lose heat fast.  Keep the roof in good repair with adequate rainwater clearance and make sure your ventilation is working by, for instance, clearing leaves from low level air intakes. In traditional buildings, all works should use breathable materials, and don't reduce the ventilation without taking advice.
