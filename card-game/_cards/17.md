**Turn off hot water preheat**

On a combi-boiler, “hot water preheat” reduces how long we wait at the taps by keeping some water hot all the time, but usually the real problem is the distance to the boiler.   Turn it off if you can.  A good electrician can disable it or make it operate using a timeswitch.  There are also valves that save water and claim to deliver hot water faster by reducing the flow at the tap until the water is hot, but we haven’t tried them.
