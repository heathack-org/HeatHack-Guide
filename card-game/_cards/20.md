**Maintain your radiators and fan convectors**

If air can’t move through a radiator or fan convector, they won’t heat the space.  Don’t let users pile things around them.  Also, dusty radiators won’t shed heat as fast as they should.  Check any fins especially. Dust in fan convectors is even worse because it can damage them.  Clean or change the filters regularly. If a radiator is cold just at the top, you should bleed it but for other problems, you’ll need your heating supplier to take a look.
