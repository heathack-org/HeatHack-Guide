**Install heated seating**

Instead of heating the air, you can warm people directly, like heated car seats do.  Some churches are moving to heated pew cushions. There are both small rechargeable ones and ones that are wired permanently into the mains.Â    Others put small heaters very close to people, like on the backs of pews and altars.  Sometimes this is the only heating and sometimes the air is heated a little too.  Heated office chairs are starting to come onto the market but we haven't tried them.
