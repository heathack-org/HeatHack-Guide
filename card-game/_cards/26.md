**Choose what spaces to use wisely**

Heat the smallest space that will suit your users - but think about what’s already warm.  Sometimes community venues will have two sets of people in on the same day but put them in different halls even though both are free.  If you can put them in the same place, you will save on heating.  This action doesn’t apply if you use “on demand” radiant heating or heated seating to keep people comfortable instead of heating the air.
