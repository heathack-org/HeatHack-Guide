**Replace single glazing with double or triple**

Double glazing makes the room more comfortable and cuts heat loss - a double win.   Triple glazing only helps more if your walls are insulated.  If you choose this action, think about trickle vents and having the openings high up so users can ventilate without wasting heat or creating draughts.  Slim-line double glazing is acceptable in many listed buildings. If you have Victorian windows in a good state, consider refurbishing them and replacing just the glass.  Theyâ€™ll have as much life left in them as a modern window.
