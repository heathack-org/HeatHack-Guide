**Use or stop solar gain**

Sometimes it is possible to modify existing buildings to make better use of the sun. That might mean an added south-facing glass structure to trap heat that will then warm the building and be useful in its own right.  For modern buildings with lots of glass that overheat through solar gain, blinds used at the right times or heat-reflecting film on the windows might help.  You may also be able to add an overhang at the right angle or place deciduous trees that will let in the sun in the winter but not in the summer.
