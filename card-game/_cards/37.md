**Install secondary glazing**

Secondary glazing is generally cheaper than double glazing, helps with the draughtproofing, and can be more acceptable in some listed buildings, but it is perhaps half as effective. A lot depends on how well the windows fit and the distance between the panes. 12mm is the ideal for heat loss, although a bigger distance is better for noise reduction.   On stained glass, it goes on the outside and with a big air gap to keep the window dry, making it less effective.
