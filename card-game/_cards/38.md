**Install temporary secondary glazing**

If you don’t need to open the windows, you can mount polycarbonate sheets on the inside of your window, for instance, using magnetic tape.  It scratches and you’ll need to find a place to store it in the summer if you can’t leave it up.  This isn’t as good as proper glazing and draughtproofing and will only last ten years, but it will make a noticeable difference to single glazing.  With very bad windows, be careful not to trap damp, and don’t try this on stained glass.
