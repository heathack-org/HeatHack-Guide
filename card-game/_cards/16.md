**Turn down your boiler thermostat**

The lower you can set the flow temperature on your condensing boiler and still warm your building in a reasonable time, the more efficient it will be - and the gentler heat might be more comfortable.  45C is ideal, and anything below 70C helps some. This action is most likely to apply to buildings with generous radiators, low heat loss, and longer heating periods. Don’t try this on a non-condensing boiler or if you have a hot water tank.
