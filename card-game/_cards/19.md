**Change to point-of-use hot water on demand**

Electric point-of-use hot water heaters only heat the hot water you need “on demand”. That’s a good change if you have an old tank that could fail soon, a condensing boiler you are only running on high to keep the tank safe from Legionella, or if you can’t predict when hot water is needed, so waste a lot of it.  It makes more sense in places without many taps.
