**Protect your heating system from interference**

Users don’t understand how boilers and storage heaters work, but if they aren’t happy, they’ll turn dials and press buttons.  Try to block access to everything they shouldn’t alter with cupboard locks or tamper-proof covers.  If your boiler is in a public space, you may need to be creative about how to use joinery or paper blu-tacked over the controls to deter use.  It’s especially important not to let users re-pressurise your boilers.  If they do it while the system is running, that could damage them.
