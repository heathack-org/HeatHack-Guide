**Share your building**

If your building is in high use, it’s easier to afford changes and get grants.  Think about whether your building is used as often as it could be. If you’re struggling to manage a building that the community would use more, you may be able to combine forces with another group that needs space or work with the local community to create a new independent charity that has the energy to run it well - and claim first dibs on their space.
