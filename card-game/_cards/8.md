**Zone your heating**

With zoning, you can heat different parts of the building at different times.  Getting the pipework, motorised valves, and timeswitch to do this isn’t always expensive.  Another approach is to use “smart” radiator valves that let you control each radiator or room independently.  That is less efficient but can be easier.  Similarly, if you have electric heating, make sure you and your users can bring on just the heating they need.
