**Get the ventilation right**

Most buildings have lots of ways to control the ventilation and assume people will be sensible.  Help your users know what to do.  You may want to add features like window trickle vents to make it easier to get enough air without wasting heat.  In “wet” rooms automatic ventilation, like extractor fans that operate based on relative humidity, can help.  If you have a church building, you might find vents left open that were designed to be opened after services to release moist air and closed before the heating goes on again.
