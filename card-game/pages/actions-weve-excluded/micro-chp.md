# Replace a boiler with a combined heat and power system

Instead of a boiler, you could have an appliance that generates electricity and harnesses the heat that is produced as a by-product of that process.  Micro-CHP (combined heat and power) systems are designed to be slot-in replacements for gas boilers.  They are a little bigger but can still be mounted on the wall.

Micro-CHP is usually more energy efficient than a gas boiler, but a Micro-CHP won't necessarily reduce your gas use.  It will reduce the amount of electricity you need to buy from your utility provider.  We haven't included it because it's a fairly niche option, and not as low carbon as a well-designed heat pump system or biomass using a sustainable fuel.
