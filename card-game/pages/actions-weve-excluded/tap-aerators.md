# Flow restricting tap aerators

A flow restricting tap aerator will make water come out of a tap less quickly.  They are sometimes called "flow regulators".  This is a good "net zero" action because it saves water.   It also saves energy because the water company has to clean up what goes through your drains and pump the water around - but this isn't energy you see on your own bills.  It's reflected in the price you pay for water.   

We haven't included this action because in community buildings it's generally more important to worry about water coming out of the tap when it's not in use.  The taps just aren't used that much. The prices for aerators and the amount of hot water used vary so much that it's hard to guess about whether the action pays back.  They also have to be cleaned regularly and might not last long, especially in hard water areas.  

If your users go through a lot of hot water, this action could save you energy, if it means you can heat less water.  If you are a sports centre or serve the homeless and supply showers, then this action might be for you.

You can judge the flow rate for a tap by filling a bucket for one minute and measuring how many litres the bucket contains.  The aerator will specify its flow rate, letting you calculate how much water it will save, typically up to 35%.  Most people fit the aerators themselves.
