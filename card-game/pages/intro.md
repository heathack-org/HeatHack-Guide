This is a cooperative game.  No one wins, but we're told it's fun.  Here's a quick reminder of how to run it:

Sit around a big table.  On one side, you'll need four labelled areas.

- **Done** for things you've already done.
- **Good for us** for things you think you should do.
- **Not for us** for things you don't think are relevant for your building and its users.
- **More information** for things that you need more information about.

Spread the cards out, and take turns choosing one that you'd like to talk about.  See what the group thinks and place the card where it belongs.  If it's good  or not for you, why is that?  If you need more information, what do you need to know?
