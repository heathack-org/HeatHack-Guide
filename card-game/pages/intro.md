This is a cooperative game.  No one wins, but we're told it's fun anyway.  

You'll need to sit around a big table.  On one side, you'll need four labelled areas:

- **Done** for things you've already done.
- **Good for us** for things you think you should do.
- **Not for us** for things you don't think are relevant for your building and its users.
- **More information** for things that you need more information about.

To use the cards, spread them on the rest of the table, and take turns choosing one that you'd like to talk about.  See what the group thinks and place the card where it belongs.  If it's good  or not for you, why is that?  If you need more information, what do you need to know?

Keep reading for the current HeatHack game. It has 48 double-sided cards.  We post them to participating groups.  As always, with the help of our volunteer engineers, we intend lots of improvements to the practical information to backup the actions.  Meanwhile, if you need help, you should ask for it!

The original HeatHack game was sent out to groups until October 2023 and has single-sided cards.  If you are introducing the cards to a new group, we will be happy to replace your pack with the new cards.  If you need the old card game website for any reason, it's linked here.

The Scottish Episcopal Church has their own version of the card game with links that are specific to them.  The tips on this page are still useful for running the game, but go to their website for the game itself.
