# The steps

Apart from the wildcard, the cards come in five steps.  Although during the game you should mix the steps up, sustainability experts recommend doing the steps in order when you carry out your plan.  For instance, any changes that address heat loss in a building usually come before specifying a new decarbonised heating system, because the heating system can then be smaller and more efficient.

**Reduce Energy Demand**

Actions that will reduce energy use now without waiting to make changes to your building or heating system.  Many of them are about controlling your current heating system.  If your group intends to change the heating system very soon, you can put those ones aside for now, but you'll still want to think which ones apply to the new system.

**Address Heat Loss**

Actions that will stop heat being lost from your building.  You need to take these if you're trying to heat the air.  They're less important if you're only heating the people with radiant heaters or heated seating, but you should still consider the ventilation cards and the more the heating is on, the more the other actions might help.

```{admonition} Where do the steps come from?

Our steps are based on the ones used by the Centre for Sustainable Energy.  

They don't have "Basic Steps", but we think these cards are important.  They are based on our experiences in community buildings, and especially on watching what users do in them.
