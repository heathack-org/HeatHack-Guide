**Wildcard**

We can’t think of everything that might suit your circumstances.  For instance, one church think they can make their hall more comfortable if they build a buggy park outside - because otherwise when the children come in, all the heat escapes.  You'll need to be curious about your building and your users to use this card well.

Sometimes good wildcard options are about making the building more suitable for the local community, not about energy efficiency - and that's OK!  Here are some things past groups have discussed:

- putting in a commercial kitchen so that users can serve hot meals
- adding a lift
- adding a way of connecting an emergency generator to the building so that it can be used by the community during a power cut
