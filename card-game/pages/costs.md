# Costs

Each card describes an action the group could take and is labelled with a cost level from 1 to 5.

The cost levels are intended to reflect the level of planning a group might need to do to bring about the change:

The costs will be highly variable for some of the cards, so these are very rough judgments.  They are probably biased towards 
traditional buildings in lower occupancy.
