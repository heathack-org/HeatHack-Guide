**Replace your boiler with a heat pump**

Heat pumps work like refrigerators in reverse.  They transfer heat from the outside air or ground to your building.  They are still expensive but there are grants available, and they have low running costs.   They can heat the air directly, but usually they circulate warm water like a boiler does.  You may need underfloor heating unless you have generous radiators and pipework thatâ€™s thick enough to deliver the heat using cooler water than from a boiler. This action works better if you address heat loss first.
