**Connect to a district heating network**

In district heating, the heat is generated somewhere nearby and delivered to you using insulated pipes.  There may be plans for future low carbon heating networks near you that use waste heat from electricity generation or industrial processes, or big heating plants that are more efficient than you can install.  Just like a heat pump, district heating delivers heat at lower temperatures than our current boilers, so it often requires underfloor heating, heat loss measures, and other expensive changes.
