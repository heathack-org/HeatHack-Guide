**Review heating and hot water timings**

The thermal monitor shows most groups that their heating isn’t on at the right times and can be turned off earlier than they think.   New controls handle summer time automatically and “optimised start control” would take the guesswork out of how early to turn the heating on.  If the problem is getting there every week to change the timings, maybe controls that let you set the times from home would help.  Also, if you store hot water, try not to heat more than your users need.
