**Force the lights offs**

Lights in community buildings get left on by accident.  In kitchens and toilets, if the same switch controls an extractor fan, this wastes not just electricity but also heat.  You could change to a light with a motion sensor or get an electrician to add one to your current light.  Motion sensors can sense movement up to 30 feet away, so can be used in relatively large rooms and donâ€™t take much power to run.
