**Check your frost arrangements**

Keeping the building dry and well-ventilated is often all the building and its contents require.   Most boilers can protect the heating system by keeping the water moving or heating it gently.  You can insulate other plumbing or use small pipe heaters where necessary.  If you really have to introduce heat, it’s much more efficient to install controls that will enforce a minimum “setback” temperature than to turn the heating on a little bit every day.
