**Insulate under the ground floor**

The heat lost through floors is usually less than through other surfaces, but a cold floor makes people uncomfortable.  For suspended timber floors, the safest options are hemp batting hung in nets under the joists or breathable boards lain on runners attached to the joists.  It can be installed by lifting a selection of floorboards.  Solid floors lose less heat than suspended ones. If a solid floor can't be lifted it can be insulated over the top or when the floor needs replaced.
