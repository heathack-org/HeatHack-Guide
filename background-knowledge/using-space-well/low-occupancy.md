# Addressing low occupancy

It's better to have buildings in high occupancy if you can.  Funders prefer to invest in buildings that serve their communities well, and the rental income from your building's users is important for being able to afford to operate the building. If you can afford to staff the building, even better, as that makes managing it easier.  Here are some ideas for things you could consider:

- NHS services or organisations that partner with the NHS to provide services, such as pop-up podiatry and mental health clinics 
- food cooperatives and food banks
- craft markets
- cafes
- community bakeries and other community-led businesses, where access to a good kitchen is often the key

For smaller, low occupancy rooms:
- organisations in need of offices
- music practice spaces
- artist's studios


If you didn't find someone well-connected in the local community to be a member of your group, you can still talk to them about what they think your building could be used for.  You could try local and community councillors, people involved in any local place planning, local business support services, or groups representing the local business community, for instance.
