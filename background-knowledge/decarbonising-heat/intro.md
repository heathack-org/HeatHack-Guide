# Space heating without gas and oil

Most organisations will have the goal of moving away from fossil fuels (also called "decarbonisation").   

For space heating, most groups will want to move to heat pumps.   A few sites will be in the catchment area for district heating schemes. There are electric boilers as well as fan convectors and radiators that use electricity directly to provide the heat, but heat pumps use so much less energy for the heat they deliver that they are probably a last resort for places that can't put a pump anywhere.


 To understand why we don't include hydrogen boilers, see the actions we have excluded.

Electric heated seating and radiant heating also move away from fossil fuels, but with a "heat the people" approach.
