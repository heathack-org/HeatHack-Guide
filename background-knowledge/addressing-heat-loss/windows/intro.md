# Heat loss through windows

If your windows are draughty, letting in excessive amounts of air around the frames, draughtproofing is likely to be just as important as upgrading the glazing, and possibly more.

If you replace the windows and not just the glass, think about what you want users to be able to do with them.  Should they be able to open them all the way, given that they might then leave them open?  If you want users to be able to open the windows, you need to make sure they can reach the easily and that they have arthritis-friendly hardware.  It's less draughty if the windows open at the top, not the bottom, making people more comfortable in the space.
