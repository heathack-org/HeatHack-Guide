# What to look for in temperature data

It won't be obvious at first sight, but it's possible to tell a fair bit about the heating system and whether it is serving the building and its users well just based on the temperature and relative humidity data from the monitors we supply.  Here are some of the things to look for.  Throughout, we're assuming space heating - a system that tries to warm all the air in a building and keep it within the building's envelope.

The plots in this section are just images so you can't use the controls to change what you see.  To try these techniques, use the Data Book.  To work with your own data, you'll need your venue number.

We are considering launching a data plotting service for those using commercial monitors, perhaps in the autumn of 2025.  Meanwhile, you can see here what to look for using the plots your monitor provides.
