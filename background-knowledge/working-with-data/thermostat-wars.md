# User modification of thermostat and TRV settings

A thermostat's set temperature won't necessarily stay the same - it's very common for different groups to have different ideas about what's comfortable in a room!  The property manager will already have a good idea about whether they have any "thermostat wars" going on in the space, but you can sometimes spot them on the plots.  On this one, it looks like a morning or afternoon group likes to set the thermostat to around 15C, causing an evening group to be cooler than they want.  Optimised start control can look the same  - instead of programming it by saying "turn the heating on at 9:00", you tell it "make it 16C by 9:00 and 18C by 18:00, and do it as efficiently as you can."  That's a very useful feature for spaces that are heated to an event schedule, but unlikely here because most evening groups start by 19:30.  This evening group is probably turning the thermostat right up when they enter and getting a nice temperature just in time to leave.

Sometimes it can be hard to tell whether something is down to user behaviour, changing external weather conditions, or poor thermostatic control.  We think the next one is a case is a mild disagreement about thermostat settings because the temperature holds well for 8 hours at a time without reaching the *asymptote* where the heating curve flattens out and can climb no higher.  It's easier to tell how long the temperature might be holding if you zoom in on the plot.
