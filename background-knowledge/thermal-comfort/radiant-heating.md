# Radiant heating

Radiant heating mostly heats the people by making the surfaces that surround them warmer.  Infrared heating is one type, but there are other wavelengths that suit different spaces.  It only has to be run while people are in the space, sometimes with a short pre-heat to warm the furnishings and building surfaces before people enter.  If you run it for long enough, it will warm the air by side effect.  Some models can be made to come on low if the temperature in the space drops low enough to be a problem for the building.

There are venues in frequent use that have radiant heating as their only heating, but we think its real strength is for venues that for some reason will remain in low occupancy or that really struggle with heat loss.  

Radiant heating  might not look like you expect.  It doesn't all glow.  Most panels are mounted high up for safety and to give them wide angle coverage of the space that keeps the warmth from being blocked by furniture.  In modern, smaller spaces, flat white ceiling panels are the most common form.  They can be hard to spot. Radiant heating can also look like long bars high up on the walls or come as chandeliers, sometimes integrated with the lighting.

Your choice isn't all or nothing.  For instance, if you want to switch to an air source heat pump but it won't cover all your heating needs, you might use the pump to provide a constant level of background heating, and just add infrared in the depths of winter or for groups that need more heating than usual.  Similarly, if you have a condensing boiler that will do service for a while yet, you could use radiant heating to allow you to run the boiler on low instead of high, perhaps providing a setback temperature, and get better energy efficiency from your gas that way, switching to a heat pump when the boiler breaks.  You could also use radiant heating as an alternative form of heating in rooms that need warmth when the rest of the space is empty.   

Radiant heating has some obvious advantages over gas boilers and heat pumps - they only need maintenance if something breaks, there's no noise and no need to site anything outside the building, and the comfort from it is instant or close enough that you can leave users to control it, getting rid of the task of programming the heating week by week.   The running cost depends on how much you use it but is easy to predict from your occupancy.

Radiant heating may be news to many of us, but they aren’t a new technology at all – they’ve been used in the more sensitive parts of hospitals for years because they don’t collect and redistribute dust like radiators do. In hospitals they are often mounted on the ceiling to keep them away from people and free up the wall space. There are ones for all different kinds and sizes of rooms.

```{admonition} Get the right design

Like with heat pumps, radiant heating has to be designed for your space or you will be disappointed with the results.   Many of the early adopters bought and installed their own equipment and didn't choose the right wavelength, power, and beam angles for their spaces.   We've taken advice from an independent heating consultant to help groups know how to avoid this problem. We were surprised when he told us to go straight to the manufacturers.  He says you can trust the reputable ones to design a system using their products to suit your space and give it even heat coverage.

The consultant named Frenger, Solray, and Consort Claudgen as reputable manufacturers, but there are almost certainly others - another source has mentioned Flexel. If you are after chandeliers, we know of two suppliers, Herschel and Electric Heating Solutions.  Any decent manufacturer will give you full technical specifications for what they sell.  If, like many of the no-brand options, they don’t, you’ll want to steer well clear.  They will often have case studies showing installations similar to what they intend for your space.  If you're unsure, ask to get in touch with previous clients who have similar spaces with the kind of installation they suggest.    Remember, we name names and show pictures because otherwise we know groups struggle to find them, but it's up to you to check.

<!-- The Consort Claudgen “Twinzone” is unusual in being able to deliver narrow beam or wide beam heating, depending on how it is assembled. -->

The manufacturers won’t usually install the panels for you. With gas boilers and heat pumps, the installer’s skills make a real difference to performance, efficiency, and longevity. With radiant panels, they don’t. Any competent electrical contractor should be able to install the equipment to a specified design but the manufacturers sometimes also have installers they recommend.  

Make sure you think about how power will be supplied to the radiant heating.  You might not have enough power available in the right places to run them, but changing this can be very expensive, especially if you need a completely new supply to the building.  Some models require a three phase supply and you might not have one.  

In heritage buildings, you’ll want to think about how the system can be mounted without damaging the building and to be careful about the potential effects of the heating on any delicate objects in the space like paintings and musical instruments.
