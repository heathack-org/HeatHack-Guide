# Fan convectors

**Fan convectors** are also designed to heat the air.  They are just radiators with a fan added to make them heat the air faster.  Just like conventional radiators, they can either be electric or heated by hot water from a boiler.  

A fan convector might provide 3 or 4 times as much heat as a radiator that fits into the same space.  That makes them very useful in buildings where there aren't enough radiators.  The fans do make some noise.  If that's a problem and your building requires a long pre-heat, you can arrange the controls to run the fan only until people enter.
