# Energy Efficiency for Community Buildings

This section of the guide reinforces the programme concepts and provides practical support for taking the actions in the card game or interpreting the thermal monitoring traces for session 3.  

As far as we are able, we write materials "on demand" in response to group questions and also work to connect groups with external services and people who can offer more expert advice.  Our eventual goal is to make it so that our materials are useful even to groups that run the programme with no interaction with us, but meanwhile, please contact us if you need something you can't see here.  


```{admonition} Do you recommend the products you mention?

Unlike many organisations, we sometimes name products and suppliers in our materials, and sometimes even include images.  These aren't recommendations.  We may not even have used or seen them in venues - unless it's in a case study, in which that will be clear.  It's just too hard to explain the actions without doing this.  If you can see and read the information about one product, you'll find it easier to find other products out there that are similar.

We are not paid or rewarded by companies for saying anything.
