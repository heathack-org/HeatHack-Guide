# Does the temperature vary too much or overshoot?

In some spaces the heating varies too much - you want to keep the temperature within a 2C band when people are in so they don't have to keep adjusting their clothing.

If you have an old analogue thermostat, you can make your users more comfortable by switching to a digital one.  Digital thermostats can hold a space within 1C either side of the set temperature.  Analogue thermostats let the temperature vary more than this.

Sometimes systems dump heat so fast that even with a digital thermostat, the temperature swings too far because the system overshoots the set temperature.  This tends to happen in smaller rooms with generously sized radiators or if there are fan convectors.  In this case, read our comments on weather and load (room) compensation and convector fan speed.

Turning down the boiler thermostat will reduce the temperature of the hot water supplied to the radiators and make the heating more gentle, but this will affect all of the rooms.
