# Enforcing a minimum temperature



If you do need to enforce a minimum temperature and you are doing this by turning the heating on for a couple of hours a day, it should pay back to update your heating controls.  On modern controls you can choose a "setback" temperature.  The system will come on whenever the temperature in the space with the thermostat drops below the "setback".  It's possible instead to wire in a separate cheap frost thermostat, but this is "second best".  It's easy for someone to get confused and set it to room temperature, plus modern controls have other advantages like optimised start control and being able to set different temperatures for different events.
