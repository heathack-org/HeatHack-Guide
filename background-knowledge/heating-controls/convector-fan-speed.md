# Convector fan speed settings

Fan convectors could be electric or they could be heated by hot water from a boiler.

If you have fan convectors, they will probably have controls that let you change the speed of the fans depending on the room temperature.  This is a special form of load (room) compensation and worth considering.  If you run the fans too fast as the room approaches your target temperature, the system is likely to overshoot and make your room too hot, wasting energy.

The controls could come as an LCD panel or a pair of dials mounted on the fan convector or under the fan convector's cover.  They will let you specify one fan speed for use while the room is warming up and a temperature at which the convector should switch to a lower speed.
