# Sensing open windows and doors

Some controls can sense when the temperature or relative humidity in a space is dropping so fast that doors or windows must be open.  They shut the heating off temporarily to avoid wasting energy.  There are community buildings for which this feature would be very useful, but it is unlikely to work well unless it is configurable so we can tell it what size drop is best for that space.  There are also systems that use actual sensors to know whether the doors and windows are open, but that starts to get fiddly and expensive.  For now, if you have a control that includes this feature, you might want to play with it, but we wouldn't consider it when choosing a control system.
