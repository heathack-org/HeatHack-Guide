# Hot water

There are several ways you might be providing hot water for your users.

- From a hot water tank or "cylinder" fed by your heating system.
- From an electric immersion heater - a heating coil inside a tank.
- From a combi-boiler heating the water on demand.
- From point-of-use hot water heaters at the taps.

Our advice depends on which you use.
