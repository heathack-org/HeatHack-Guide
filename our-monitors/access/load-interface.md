# Access monitor using browser


One you are connected, you can configure the thermal monitor using your browser.  Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Samsung Internet and Microsoft Edge are all web browsers.  You can search for your browser app just like you can search to find your wifi settings.  At the top of the browser, you will find the "address bar".  Enter 192.168.4.1 to access the monitor.

```{admonition} Common error message

Some web browsers like Safari require secure communication by default.  Others give you the option to require it.  Our monitor is too cheap to communicate securely.  If you get an error message about HTTP, HTTPS, or security, you will need to change your settings temporarily to allow HTTP connections while you set up the hub.
