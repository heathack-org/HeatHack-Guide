On your device, look for the "heathack-s" wifi hotspot. When you see it, connect to it using the password "heathack".  Your device might warn you that you won't be able to use the internet, but that's OK.

````{admonition} Tip

You can make your phone, tablet, or laptop check for the heathack-s network more frequently to speed things up.  On a phone, it is usually done by pulling down from the top to refresh the wifi network list.  On a Windows laptop, the list will refresh every time you click on the circled button.

Rarely, the heathack-s can take a long time to appear.  We are still attempting to find out why.  If it has been two minutes, you will have to turn the device off, wait 10 seconds, and try again or try our access troubleshoot tips.
