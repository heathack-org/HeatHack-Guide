# Turn on the monitor 
Once you have your wifi settings open, turn on the monitor.  If the monitor is on, turn it off using the on/off switch, wait 10 seconds, and turn it on again.

The number one reason people contact us is they didn't wait 10 seconds.  Please be patient!

Turning the monitor on starts a wifi "hot-spot" that you can connect to.  This is just like connecting to any
other wifi network, except there are only two things on this network:  the thermal monitor and your device.  While you are connected to the monitor, your normal wifi connection to the internet will be disconnected, so you will be unable to use the internet until you have finished setting up the monitor.

From when you turn the monitor on, you will have 2 minutes to complete the setup before the monitor goes to sleep to save its battery.



```{admonition} Important

Only one person at a time should try to connect to the monitor.   If you have trouble and someone else wants to try with their device, turn the monitor off, wait 10 seconds, and turn it on again.

If you are in any doubt about whether your batteries are still OK, look for a hole in the box.  Turn the device off, wait 10 seconds, and turn it on again.  You should be able to see a blue LED flash through the hole.  If the on-off switch breaks, you may need a replacement.  It might work to stop and start the monitor by removing and reinserting a battery, but the monitors don't always start up nicely if you do this.
