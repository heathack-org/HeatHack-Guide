Open your web browser and type “192.168.4.1” into the address bar at the top.  You might have a separate "search" bar.  Using that won't work.  Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Samsung Internet and Microsoft Edge are all web browsers.  This will only work when you are connected to the engineer wifi access point.  If your web browser gives you a set of web searches, you aren't connected. 


```{admonition} Common error message

Some web browsers like Safari require secure communication by default.  Others give you the option to require it.  Our monitor isn't powerful enough to communicate securely.  If you get an error message about HTTP, HTTPS, or security, you will need to change your settings temporarily to allow HTTP connections while you set up the hub.
