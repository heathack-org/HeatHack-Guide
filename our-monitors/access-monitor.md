# Accessing the monitor


You must follow these instructions to access the screens that will let you set up the monitor.   The internet address printed on the monitor is for seeing if it works, **not** part of the set up procedure.

Try these instructions at home with a cup of tea before taking the monitor to your community building.  That way you'll be relaxed with a bit more time and already know where the wifi works well.

```{admonition} Important

Your monitor can't connect to the internet.  It just makes a wifi connection between your phone, laptop, or tablet and the monitor so you can set it up.  It's also too cheap to be able to follow modern security standards.

- Sometimes it's necessary to relax your security settings temporarily while you make the connection.  You can, and should, change them back again afterwards.

- Some phones and laptops will disconnect from the monitor as soon as they see that the monitor can't connect to the internet, especially if there's another network available that can, unless you change what the phone does.

Try accessing the monitor, and if you have trouble, go to the page with troubleshooting tips to overcome thse issues.
