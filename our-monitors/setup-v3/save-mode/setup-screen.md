# Starting the monitor

If you chose "save" mode, you will now see this screen:

```{image} /images/monitoring/v3/get-data-and-start.jpg
:alt: sensor unit location photo
:class: mb-1
:width: 200px
:align: center
```



Where it says "Enter the location", enter a text string that will help you remember where the monitor was when the data was collected.  It's helpful if this is the same string every time the monitor is in the same place.  Please avoid using spaces.  You can use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead. Then click on "Get data and start".
