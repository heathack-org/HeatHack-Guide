```{admonition} Tip
:class: Tip
The first time, try the monitor at home or some other place where you can be comfortable and not too rushed.  Once you turn the monitor on, you have a couple of minutes to set it up before it goes to sleep, but you can always start again.

We will take you through four steps to set up the monitor:

1. Make sure your device won't try to connect to the internet while you are setting up the monitor.
1. Turn the monitor on and use the heathack-s wifi network to connect to it. 
1. Use your browser to go to a special web address, 192.168.4.1, to select save mode. 
1. Enter a brief description of where you are putting the monitor and download the data.

There is no way to set up the monitor without downloading the data that is already stored on it.  If you don't want the data, throw it away.  Otherwise, send it to data@heathack.org.
