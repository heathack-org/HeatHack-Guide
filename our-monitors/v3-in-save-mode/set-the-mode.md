You should now see this screen.  Check that the readings look sensible and contact us if they do not, as your monitor may be damaged.  Temperature is in Celsius and "humidity" is relative humidity, a number between 0 and 100 where 0 is extremely dry and 100 is extremely damp.   The temperature might look high if you have been handling the device.  

If the readings look OK, choose internet mode and submit.
