:class: Tip
The first time, try the monitor at home or some other place where you can be comfortable and not too rushed.  Once you turn the monitor on, you have a couple of minutes to set it up before it goes to sleep, but you can always start again.

<!--
We will take you through three steps to set up the monitor:

1. Make sure your device won't try to connect to the internet while you are setting up the monitor.
1. Turn the monitor on and use the heathack-NUM wifi network to connect to it, where NUM is your venue number.
1. Use your browser to go to a special web address, 192.168.4.1, to choose internet or save mode. For internet mode, enter your wifi network name (SSID) and password.
