Open your web browser and type 192.168.4.1 into the address bar at the top.  Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Samsung Internet and Microsoft Edge are all web browsers.

Searching on 192.168.4.1 won't work, but sometimes it's hard to tell when a browser will treat something as an address and when it will treat it as a search term. If you can't figure it out, let us know. 

```{admonition} Common error message

Some web browsers like Safari require secure communication by default.  Others give you the option to require it.  Our monitor isn't powerful enough to communicate securely.  If you get an error message about HTTP, HTTPS, or security, you will need to change your settings temporarily to allow HTTP connections while you set up the hub.
