You will get a notification that a file has been downloaded. Try to open it.  You may see an error message saying the filetype is not supported, but your phone should allow you to open a list of downloaded files. 

The correct file is named "datalog.csv", possibly followed by a number if you've downloaded data before.  You always want the most recent one.  This is usually the one with the highest number.
 Select the correct file by holding your finger on it, and then choose "Share" and the icon of the email app you want to use.  Gmail, Mail, and Outlook are common email apps. This will start composing an email message with the data file already attached.  Send the email to  **data@heathack.org**. 


If you can't find the option to share the file with us by email, you can open your email, start a message to us, and attach it to the message.  The file will be wherever your internet downloads go.

<!-- 
- Press "open" on the notification for the datalog file download.
    - You may get an error message saying that you cannot open the
file or that the type is not supported. You should then be directed to
a "Files" "My files" or "Downloads" app.

- Long press on the " 'datalog.csv' " file to get an option to share
the file. Press "share"

- Select the app that you use for your emails. This will open a new
email with the file attached. Send this email to data@heathack.org
