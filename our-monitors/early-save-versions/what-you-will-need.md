# What will you need

To set up the monitor, you will need:

* A smartphone, tablet, or computer with wifi that you can use in your building, usually a laptop.  We'll call this a "device". 
* Batteries.  
    - If your monitor takes three batteries, it takes ordinary alkaline AA batteries.  They should last around a year.  You can use rechargeable NiMH AA batteries, but they won't last as long.
    - If your monitor takes two batteries, you need AA lithium batteries.  They should last around a year.  Alkaline batteries will work, but only for a week or two. Rechargeable batteries will not work. AA lithium batteries are usually used in things like smoke detectors. Energizer is the most common brand. You can get them online or from Argos in most large Sainsbury's.  


```{admonition} Battery safety
:class: important

* Don't leave the batteries or the monitor in very hot places.
* Make sure there is airflow around the monitor when it is running so it can't overheat. 
* Don't try to recharge non-rechargeable batteries. 
* If you post batteries to anyone, package them correctly.
