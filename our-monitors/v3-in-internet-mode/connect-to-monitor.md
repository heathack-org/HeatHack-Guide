On your device, look for the "heathack-s" wifi hotspot. When you see it, connect to it using the password "heathack".  Your device might warn you that you won't be able to use the internet, but that's OK.

```{admonition} Tips
:class: tip

- Only one person at a time should try to connect to the monitor. 

- You can make your phone, tablet, or laptop check for the heathack-s network more frequently to speed things up.  On a phone, it is usually done by pulling down from the top to refresh the wifi network list.  On a Windows laptop, the list will refresh every time you click on the network connection icon in the taskbar.
