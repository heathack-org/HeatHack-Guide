Go to wifi settings and wait for the heathack-i network to appear.  When it does, connect to it.  It doesn't require a password. Then in your browser, go to 192.168.4.1 again.   Choose "Configure Wifi" and find wifi network that you wish to use to connect the monitor to the internet.   If you don't see the one you want, refresh the list by choosing "Scan".  Then enter the wifi password and choose "Save". 

The heathack-i hotspot will shut down and your monitor will try to connect to the internet using the building's wifi.

```{admonition} If your wifi network isn't listed
:class: tip

You might be out of range.  Move to a place where you're sure the wifi signal is strong.

Some venues deliberately hide the wifi network to keep people from connecting to it.  In this case you can type in its name (SSID).  

In other venues, the network name (SSID) will be very slow to appear even if you keep scanning for it.  In extreme cases, it can take so long your monitor will go to sleep.  If you find this is a problem, contact us.
