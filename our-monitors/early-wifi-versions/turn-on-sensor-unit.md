Now turn on the sensor unit.  

The faint blue LED on the hub will flash every time it receives data from the sensor unit.  This is useful for checking that the radio on the sensor unit can reach the hub. Unfortunately, sometimes the LED shifts out of alignment with the hole so to see it, you have to remove the Philips screw and open the case.

When the sensor unit is first turned on, it sends data to the hub every 10 seconds for 2 minutes.   If the hub doesn't flash, then it may be out of radio range. Try it closer first to check.  You may find aligning the aerials inside the sensor unit and hub increases the range.  Some units have arrows on the cases indicating the aerial direction.  

After two minutes, the sensor sends readings less frequently, usually every five minutes.
