Once you have set it up, the monitor will take temperature and relative humidity readings and send them to the internet immediately.  It will send three readings five minutes apart.   This is so you can quickly check the monitor is working using the web address printed on the box. 

After this, the monitor will save readings up to save battery.  You will able to see new readings arrive at the URL on the box every 1-10 hours. The web address on the box is just for checking that the monitor is working.  When you want to think about the data, use the HeatHack Data Book instead.  Your venue number is written on the box above the HeatHack logo.
