# Electric meter safety

<!-- taken from a clamp-on meter guide, so been past someone's legal. -->

Although taking electricity meter readings is generally safe, you do need to be careful around them.  If they are badly maintained they could be dangerous to touch.  Three phase supplies can give you a bigger shock than single phase ones and so require extra care.

```{admonition} Danger of electric shock
:class: important

**WARNING: Touching exposed electrical wires or components may result in electric shock, causing possible death or injury.**


These are all signs that it is unsafe to approach your meter: 

 - corroded cable insulation
 - exposed copper wires 
 - burning odours 

 If unsure, contact a qualified electrician.
