Welcome to the HeatHack programme for UK community building operators.  This is the "Guide Book" for participating venues.  It explains the programme and provides links to all publicly available materials for it. 

We are always learning from our venues doing our best to respond to their needs.  Please tell us what we should add.  

This project was supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering under the Ingenious Awards programme. We are grateful for their support.

**Scottish Episcopal Church congregations**

If you are from the Scottish Episcopal Church, yes, you **are** in the right place.  They are adopting our programme for their new Net Zero workshops, with a team in place to help congregations use it and also help them act on their plans.  Please bear with us while they get their Net Zero team in place and take over providing this support.

The Scottish Episcopal Church has their own version of the card game with links that are specific to them.  The tips on this page are still useful for running the game, but go to their website for the game itself.  It just has their own design plus a few extra cards, like using green energy tariffs. You can get the cards from your Diocese office.

There are also special SEC versions of the session schedules.  These are very similar to the main programme, but are designed to allow for a break for vestry approval before thinking about community engagement, in case that is how things work in your charge.  You have an option of 3 2-hour sessions or 2 3-hour sessions, but most groups find they want an additional "free-form" session to finish their planning, plan for community engagement, or both.

Originally this website had supplementary reading materials for the programme.  We  are currently rewriting it to contain almost everything, pointing to Google documents for the rest, to make our programme less confusing.  Please bear with us while we do this.
