Open your wifi settings.  If the monitor is already on, turn it off using the on/off switch and wait 10 seconds. Slide the lid off and check the batteries are in properly.  Then put the lid back and turn the monitor on.

<!-- From when you turn the monitor on, you will have 2 minutes to complete the setup before the monitor goes to sleep to save its battery. -->

```{admonition} Tips
:class: tip
 
- The number one reason people contact us is they didn't wait 10 seconds.  Please be patient! 
- If you are in any doubt about whether your batteries are still OK, turn the monitor on when you have the lid off the box and look for a blue flash of light.  Some monitors have a hole in the box for viewing the light.  
- If the on-off switch breaks, you may need a replacement.  It might work to stop and start the monitor by removing and reinserting a battery, but the monitors don't always start up nicely if you do this.
