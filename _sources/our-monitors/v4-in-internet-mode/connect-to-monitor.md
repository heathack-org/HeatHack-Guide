On your device, look for the "heathack-NUM" wifi hotspot, where NUM is your venue number. When you see it, connect to it using the password "heathack".  Your device might warn you that you won't be able to use the internet, but that's OK.

```{admonition} Tips
:class: tip

- Only one person at a time should try to connect to the monitor. 

- You can make your phone, tablet, or laptop check for the heathack-s network more frequently to speed things up.  On a phone, it is usually done by pulling down from the top to refresh the wifi network list.  On a Windows laptop, the list will refresh every time you click on the network connection icon in the taskbar.
