# Starting the monitor

:::::{grid} 

::::{grid-item} 
:columns: 6

Where it says "Enter the location", enter a text string that will help you remember where the monitor was when the data was collected.  It's helpful if this is the same string every time the monitor is in the same place.  Please avoid using spaces.  You can use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead. Then click on "Get data and start".
