You should now see the sensor unit's interface.  Check the temperature and relative humidity shown look sensible.  If not, see the troubleshooting page.

For the location, enter a word or two that will remind you where you've left the unit; for instance "main-hall".  You can use hyphens and underscores if you wish, but avoid spaces.  Please try to use the same description for the same location every time.

<!-- Enter the location of your device using the three letter code for your site plus a word that will remind you where it is - for instance, "ccm-hall" for the hall at venue "ccm".  You can use hyphens and underscores if you wish, but avoid spaces.
CK says the code is unnecessary, we will use MAC address as a key.

When you press "download data and start", your phone will download a file containing the data and then start logging.  You have four minutes to do this but the battery will last longer if you are faster.


 **Please use "download and start" even if you have no data to download and only wish to start the sensor recording.** The sensor will record data when it is turned on even if you don't, but it won't get the correct date and time.
