# Turn the sensor unit on and connect to the "engineer" wifi hotspot

If the sensor unit is already on, turn it off, wait ten seconds, then turn it on again.  A wifi hotspot named "engineer" will appear.  Connect to it using the password "heathack".  Ignore any warnings about internet availability - connect to the hotspot anyway.

You have around one minute to do this step and the next one but if you take longer, you can start again.  

```{admonition} One at a time

Only one person at a time should try this step - the monitor gets confused if two people are both trying to connect. If you have trouble and someone else wants to try with their phone, turn the sensor unit off and on again.
