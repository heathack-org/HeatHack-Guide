On your device, look for the "heathack-s" wifi hotspot. When you see it, connect to it using the password "heathack".  Your device might warn you that you won't be able to use the internet, but that's OK.

```{admonition} Tip
Rarely, the heathack-s can take a long time to appear.  We are still attempting to find out why.  If it has been two minutes, you will have to turn the device off, wait 10 seconds, and try again.
