# Find your device's wifi settings

Open the wifi settings on your smartphone or laptop and find the available networks.  How to do this depends on the device you have.

- on most Android phones, swipe up from the bottom to get to your "All Apps" screen and look for an icon labelled "Settings".  If you have many apps, you may need to swipe left or right to see them all.  Choose "Connections" and then "Wifi".
