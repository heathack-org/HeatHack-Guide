# Batteries

If we are unable to get batteries to you, you will need to buy them locally.

Unless we tell you otherwise, the sensor unit uses AA **lithium** batteries.  This is the kind of battery used in things like smoke alarms. They are the same size and shape as ordinary alkaline AA batteries, but should last a year.  Energizer is the most common brand. If you need to buy them, they can be found on-line or from Argos at major branches of Sainsbury's.  We are now (November 2023) trialling an alkaline battery version at a few sites, but we will tell you if you are one of them.

If you are a group supported by our Royal Academy of Engineering Ingenious programme funding, we are now shipping batteries within our monitors and if you need replacements, you can charge the cost on expenses.

```{admonition} Important

Don't use NiMH rechargeable batteries - they won't work because the voltage will be too low.  You can use alkaline batteries temporarily, but they won't last more than a couple of weeks and the relative humidity readings will become inaccurate when the voltage drops too far.

```{admonition} Safety
:class: important

* Do not attempt to recharge lithium batteries.  These are very different from the lithium-ion batteries in phones.  
* Don't leave the batteries in very hot places.
* Make sure there is airflow around the monitor when it is running so it can't overheat. 
* If you post batteries to anyone, package them correctly.

These are the same fire safety tips as for alkaline batteries, but these batteries store more energy, so it's more important to remember them.
