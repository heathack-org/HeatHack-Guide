Check that the readings look sensible and contact us if they do not, as your monitor may be damaged.  Temperature is in Celsius and "humidity" is relative humidity, a number between 0 and 100 where 0 is extremely dry and 100 is extremely damp.   The temperature might look a bit high if you have been handling the device.  

If the readings look OK, choose internet mode or save mode, and click on Submit.  

At this point what you need to do depends on which mode you choose.
