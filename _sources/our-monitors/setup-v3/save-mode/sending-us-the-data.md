# Sending us the data

On a laptop, you can start an email to us and add the data file as an attachment. 

This is also possible on other devices, but it can be tricky to find the file. There is often an easier way - when you get the notification that the file has downloaded, there should be an option to "share" it.  Here are some icons that might be used to mean "share". 


::::{grid} 1 1 1 2 
:gutter: 2

:::{grid-item-card}  Typical Apple icon for sharing

:::{grid-item-card} Typical Android icon for sharing 
```{image} /images/monitoring/android-share-icon.jpg

```

And this is what it looks like in context on one Android phone - when the icon is clicked, the list of possible ways of sharing comes up including Gmail, an email application.

```

Choosing the email application will create an email with the file attached.  Send the email to data@heathack.org.
