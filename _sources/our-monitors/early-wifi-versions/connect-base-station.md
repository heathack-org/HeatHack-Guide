 Decide where to place the sensor unit, and plug in the hub not too far away.  You can use an electric socket or a USB socket that always has power, for instance, on a router or some computers.   The hub has a blue LED just visible through the case that will flash once in case you need confirmation that the power is working. 
 
 On a phone or tablet, then find your wifi settings. You can access them through the settings icon (a gear) on your home screen or by searching.
