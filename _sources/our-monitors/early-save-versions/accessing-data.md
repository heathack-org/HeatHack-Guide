# Using the data


At least twice a day, we copy the data to the Data Book for better plotting and so that you can have easy access to download it for plotting in Excel if you wish.  You need your venue number to use it.

If you move your sensor around it's useful to have a diary of its location.  You could use this template for  it:

It's also very useful to know who was in the building when - at least a sense of how weeks usually are, but even better, the actual building use.  This will let you judge whether users are comfortable when they are on your premises and whether the heating is coming on at the right times.  We often spot major wastes by checking the diary against the data.  We intend to add this information to the Data Book for venues that fill in this template:

At the moment most groups either eyeball occupancy using the Data Book or use this spreadsheet to show occupancy against temperature.
