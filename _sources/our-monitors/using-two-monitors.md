# Using two monitors at once

Some venues are able to build a second monitor or borrow one from another venue.  With version 3 monitors, there's no problem - they will all connect to the internet independently.

With earlier monitors, if you run them both in internet mode, all the readings end up on one ThingSpeak feed.  Please instead run one of the monitors in "save" (standalone) mode.  The process for setting this up is very like the version 3 instructions but you have to visit a hidden webpage:

- power-cycle the sensor unit
- connect to the engineer wifi access point (password "heathack") 
- visit http://192.168.4.1/extra 
- first button lets you switch to Memory, then click on Submit.

If you do get two sets of readings tangled let us know - we may be able to separate them for you.
