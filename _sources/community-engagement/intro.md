# Community engagement

In the last session, after coming to a consensus about what you think is right for the future of your premises, you plan how to engage with the local community over what you found.

In the version of the programme that is two three hour sessions, you will only get as far as recommending the general approach to take to community engagement and what sort of "stakeholders" - people who have some kind of interest in your building - should be involved.  Your organisation will still need to finish planning and run the community engagement.   

<!-- ```{admonition} Scottish Episcopal Church Net Zero Workshops

The SEC version of the programme doesn't include community engagement.  This doesn't mean it's not important!  The SEC has chosen to have their Net Zero Workshops report to Vestry, with Vestry taking over from there.
