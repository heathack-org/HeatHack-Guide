Our goal is to make this guide so clear and comprehensive that reading the early sections is all you need to run the programme well, but we are happy offer whatever form of training you feel you need to be good group leaders and engineers providing support to the group.

When we started out, we offered on-line video training sessions separately for group leaders and engineers.  You can find the materials we used for these here, but you have to request access to the video recordings themselves if you want them as we do not have permission to release them publicly on the internet:

- [Engineer Training](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vPF3z6kf3Eln4PPJ3IRys1YV_IPAh5zx?usp=drive_link)
- [Start an email to request training video access](mailto:admin@heathack.org?subject=training%20videos)

The group leader training video is very long because we assumed leaders wouldn't know how to facilitate groups so that everyone's voices would be heard. In practice, most of them didn't need this.  The training materials have a schedule to help you skip over parts of the videos.  

Please tell us what you need.  

- Often the group leader and engineer read the early parts of the Guide Book and then arrange a call to ask questions and discuss their building and any programme adaptations they think they should make.
- We could offer online training sessions to groups of venues, or face-to-face ones within reasonable travelling distance from Edinburgh. 
- We can arrange blitz introductions to the programme to representatives from a range of organisations in a locale that provide much of the same support we would ordinarily provide during training.
- We can also train the staff of partners who want to support associated venues to go through the programme and provide backup to ensure their success.
