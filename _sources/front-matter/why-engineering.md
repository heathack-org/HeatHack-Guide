# Why an engineer?
  

Engineers use science to solve problems.  They're good at thinking about time, budget constraints, and payback periods, because the whole point of engineering is to make things that work in the real world for real clients. They are also used to thinking about Health and Safety, documenting technical details, and laying out the pros and cons of various options.  This helps when making decisions, getting professional advice, and writing proposals for funding.  

Community groups often look around for a volunteer with special skills in finance, fundraising, IT, and child protection.  We think that whenever a community group plans changes to a building, they should look around for an engineer, too.
