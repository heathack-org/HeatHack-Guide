# Is this for us?

Our programme helps community groups reduce energy use and plan changes to their buildings that will move them towards net zero.  Many of our groups are concerned about climate change, but they are also worried about their heating bills, want to get energy efficiency grants while they are available, or need to know what to do when their boiler fails.   The programme is designed to help groups understand the big picture and give consultants and architects the right briefs so they can make use of their time more effectively. Some groups do the programme because they have received consultancy reports and still don't know what to do or feel the report doesn't quite fit them.

 Many community buildings are churches and ex-church buildings, and we will have extra things to say about them, because they are particularly difficult buildings to get right.  However, you don't need to have one of these buildings to take part.  The programme is intended for any community group with a building over 10 years old where they suspect energy is being wasted, especially from heating, a building's largest energy use - as long as those who control what can happen in and to building are receptive to change.

```{note} 

This programme is not the place to debate whether climate change exists or whether human behaviour has the power to affect its course for good or ill.  

It is also not the place to discuss climate change and its effects on the planet, although if that is your main interest, you may wish to consider two other programmes from The Surefoot Effect, Climate Conversations and Conversations for Change. 


- <a href="https://www.surefoot-effect.com/climate-conversations.html">Climate Conversations</a>
- <a href="https://www.scottishcommunitiescan.org.uk/host-a-conversation/">Conversations for Change</a>

If you are in an organisation where there's a group that desires change but it is difficult to achieve because those who control what can happen in and to a building can't see the point, the programme might help you discover actions that make sense to them - but keep in mind that your journey is going to be much harder.  In this case, we would recommend using our materials but probably not going through the entire programme - find some easy wins first with clear financial cases and you can build common ground that way.  We are happy for our materials to be used in any way you think will work and where we can, we will help you make them fit your circumstances.
