 # Introduction

Controlling energy use in community buildings and halls is difficult, but important both for the sake of the planet and to reduce the financial risks of an uncertain future.   This programme is designed to help you understand energy use in your premises as well as what can be done to reduce it and still serve the community well.   It combines quick, inexpensive actions that sometimes cut energy use substantially with longer term planning to take advantage of new, greener ways of running our buildings.

This programme assumes your group wishes to consider changes to your premises with a view to reducing its energy use. 

- For some groups, this desire will arise from a deeply felt ethical concern for the planet and its inhabitants.  
- For others, it arises because of pressure from above, for instance, as organisations and governments make policies requiring a move away from fossil fuels.
- Some have an eye on government grants encouraging change.
- For still others, volatile and rising energy prices or dwindling income will be foremost in their minds. 
 

All of these are valid reasons for taking part.

The goal of the programme is to guide you through the process of making decisions about what to do with your buildings when and help you make an actionable plan.  The programme won't make anyone into a technical expert, but it will equip you with the right concepts and information to engage confidently with building professionals and get better outcomes for your community.  It will also help your community think about your situation and agree what should be done, an important outcome in itself.  This might include considering changes to how your buildings are used and for what, especially if your buildings are currently under-used. 

We hope you find the programme useful in your journey, and that together we can build a better future for all of us.
