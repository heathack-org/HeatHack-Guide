# Gas safety

Sometimes gas boilers in community buildings aren't very well maintained.  Soot around the appliance, a yellow or orange weak flame instead of a blue one, or a pilot light that blows out easily are all signs that a gas leak is more likely.

- Do not smoke or light matches
- Do not turn electrical switches on or off
- Open all doors and windows
- Turn off the meter at the control handle if possible
- Call the National Gas Emergency number (0800 111 999)

```{admonition} Safety
:class: important

Gas meters are especially dangerous, and for this reason storage in gas meter cupboards or rooms is not allowed. There must be a large air gap between any electrical devices and the meter.  Sometimes technology enthusiasts attach devices to gas meters to take meter readings automatically.  This can be **dangerous**, and your supplier will let you know that they are very unhappy if they find out.  In particular, **never plug a cable into a gas meter** even if you recognise the connector and have a cable with a connector that fits.  If it applies power to the meter, this could cause an explosion.
