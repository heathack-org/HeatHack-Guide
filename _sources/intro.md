# Welcome

Welcome to the HeatHack programme for UK community building operators.  This is the "master guide" for participating venues.  It explains the programme and provides links to all publicly available materials for it. 

```{admonition} Scottish Episcopal Church

If you are from the Scottish Episcopal Church, yes, you **are** in the right place.  They are adopting our programme for their new Net Zero workshops.  Please bear with us while they get their Net Zero team in place and take over programme administration for their congregations.
```
 
We are always learning from our venues doing our best to respond to their needs.  Please tell us what we should add.  

This project was supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering under the Ingenious Awards programme. We are grateful for their support.

```{note}
Originally this website had supplementary reading materials for the programme.  We  are currently rewriting it to contain almost everything, pointing to Google documents for the rest, to make our programme less confusing.  Please bear with us while we do this.
