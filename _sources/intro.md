# Welcome

Welcome to the HeatHack programme for community building operators.  This is the "master guide" for participating venues.  It explains the programme and provides links to all publicly available materials for it.
 
We are always learning from our venues doing our best to respond to their needs.  Please tell us what we should add.  
<!-- 
```{note}
Originally this website had supplementary reading materials for the programme.  We  are currently rewriting it to contain almost everything, pointing to Google documents for the rest, to make our programme less confusing.  Please bear with us while we do this.
