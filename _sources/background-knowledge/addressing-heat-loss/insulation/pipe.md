# Pipe insulation

You can use slip-on DIY pipe insulation, but professionals have access to better materials and should be able to insulate the tricky bits, not just the straight sections.

If you have uninsulated pipes, think about whether they are shedding useful heat.  If they are in a room that the heating serves, the heat output of the pipes might be important to make the room warm.  This is especially likely if it's an old system with fat pipes.

Sometimes community groups insulate pipes not to keep them warm but to make sure no one can burn themselves if they touch them.
