# Motion sensing

<!-- Start again here TODO -- problem is extractor fans  needs a separate page -->

Lights in community buildings are frequently left on by accident.  Motion sensing can be a good solution, but some community buildings report that the lights keep coming on by themselves, which might be more waste fulthan manual control. 

Passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors can sense movement up to 30 feet away, so can be used in relatively large rooms, and don't take much power to run.  Some lights and fans have motion sensing built in.  For others, you can have an electrician add a separate motion sensor.
