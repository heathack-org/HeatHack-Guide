# Controls compatibility

Unfortunately, not all controls are compatible with all boilers.  We've already mentioned that it matters whether your boiler is a modern modulating one or an old one that can only run at one output level.  Although modulating boilers can use controls made for on/off boilers, that gives up their energy efficiency advantage.  In addition, some manufacturers lock down their boilers to only work with their own controls.  Others are more permissive and will work with any control that uses the OpenTherm standard.
