# Brief activities

There are some brief activities to help the group work well together:


- **Icebreakers.**  These are designed to get people's heads into the room on gently onto the topic, and to be something very brief where everyone can contribute, as a subtle reminder that even the quiet or those who don't feel they are "experts" still have an important role to play here.  It's not important to remember what was said. 

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

If you go first in the icebreaker, you can model good behaviour by giving a brief response.  This will make it easier to keep it moving.  You can sound encouraging as you move on to the next person, but avoid commenting and discourage responses from others.   An icebreaker isn't a discussion, but a sharing without comment.
```

- **Preparing to learn in pairs or as a whole group.**  These conversations get the group ready to think about new concepts and have the group talk about something they already know about, often to do with their home or past experience.  Early sessions do this in pairs because many people find this less daunting than speaking in front of the whole group.   In the later sessions, people have usually "warmed up" a bit.  As group leaders, you can't hear what happens in the pairs, and that's OK.  You don't need to remember what was said.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

If the group has an odd number of people, the leader or the engineer can take a break! Mix up the pairs and groups in case anyone is having a bad experience.  Don't hover. As long as the group understands what they should talk about, they'll be fine.  

```

- **Idea storms.**  These get as many ideas from the group as possible in a short time.  The group leader should manage the group to keep the ideas coming, with the engineer writing them down,  either on a flipchart or by typing them into a document while projecting them on a screen so everyone can see.   We just have one early in the session as a way for the group to start working together and to get a sense of each other's concerns. It helps the engineer understand the technical level of the group members and the group leader to see what the group dynamics are like.  You don't need to record anything about what happens, although there's no harm in photographing the flip-chart or saving the document.  We would expect anything important to come up again during the sessions.  


```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

Don't evaluate or discuss any of the suggestions - they should come thick and fast. If one person speaks at length, you'll need to interrupt to move them on.  It can help to make it clear when there's just a few minutes left and to ask if someone who hasn't spoken for a while has any ideas.  If the engineer can't figure out what to write on the flipchart, the group leader can help by suggesting the words or asking the group if they can think of three words that sum up the idea.  
```


<!-- -  **Engineer talks.** These are short talks that introduce new concepts the group needs to make good decisions, followed by a chance for the group to ask questions.  We provide a storyline for these talks and suggestions about how to give them.   Engineers choose to do these different ways. Most just speak and point to things in the room to illustrate their points.  Some weave in what they know of the premises and how it is used to illustrate the talk.  A few make Powerpoint presentations, and others draw an emerging picture on the flipchart.  If you need support to give the talks, just let us know. 

- **Activities.** These help the groups apply the concepts to their premises and how they use them.  Activities often look like games.    Together, the activities build up to a profile of the building and how the community wants to use it plus a plan for future changes - the outcome of the group.  Remember to document as much as possible.  Photographs can be a quick and easy way to show the result of an activity and are very useful for making documents you can submit later to architects, heating and energy efficiency consultants, and grant funders.

```{admonition} Complex premises
:class: tip

Some of the groups in the programme have one relatively simple building, but some have multiple buildings or buildings that are split into many rooms.  For these, you won't have time to perform activities relating to all of them, and you won't be able to gather thermal monitoring data for all spaces, either.  Don't be tempted to try to cover too much.  During the activities, if you need to, you can focus on one key space or one building, or one key space and an example side space. This will reinforce the concepts that the group is learning.

At the end of a session, the group can agree what they want to do that relates to the other spaces.  They might want to do nothing, repeat some exercises themselves outside sessions, or just agree what the implications are for their other spaces, depending on what time they have and what they already know about their buildings.

- **Making decisions as a group.** Towards the end of each session the groupneeds to decide on actions to be taken before the next session.  Some of these are needed as preparation, and some of them might be voluntary agreement of extra things they want to do to understand some aspect of the building and how they use it that they think might be problematic. Running these items is much like chairing regular meetings.  Some of the same tips apply as for idea storms.  If you are struggling to summarise the sense of the group, a good approach is asking if anyone else can.  

- **Wrap up.** There is always something brief to bring the session to a tidy ending. 

We don't have more to say about these activities in this guide, but the session schedules give enough information to run them.
