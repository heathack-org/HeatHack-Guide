# Temperature and relative humidity readings


Regular temperature readings are very useful for understanding where you are wasting energy on heating.  Monitoring often indicates that a small change in practice or a small investment in different heating controls will save enough money to be worth the bother.  In buildings that are slow to warm up and not used all the time, it's common to discover a quarter of the heating is wasted, and we have sometimes found much bigger problems, like a church hall that had accidentally been heated 24/7 for years.  Monitoring will also help you understand and handle user complaints and know when maintenance is required.

Your heating controls might already log room temperature for you.

Relative humidity readings are also useful if you have any concerns about damp or dryness in your building.  That might be because you want to be sure the conditions are right for people, or it might be because you want to safeguard the building or its contents.  This is less important than recording temperature because if it's too damp or too dry for the people in the building, it should be obvious.  However, if you are a church with a pipe organ or other sensitive furnishings, or a building with unfrequented spaces that you think might be damp, it's useful to have a device capable of monitoring relative humidity (RH) so you can use it for this some of the time.  It's difficult to measure relative humidity accurately so you should treat the readings as approximate.

If you have the money, you can get a commercial "data logger".  These are usually USB sticks and are easy to use with free software provided.  The cheaper options don't send data to the internet.  Instead, you have to pick up the data using the software on a computer.   There are several companies that make them.  It costs around £45 to get a commercial temperature logger, £65 to get one that logs temperature and relative humidity, and £140 to get one that sends data to the internet for cloud storage.    
Devices from less established companies might be cheaper, but it's possible you get what you pay for - we aren't sure.  Lascar Easylog USB is a common choice so you could compare your options to those.

We haven't tried this, but Thermopro has a cheaper device now that sounds very useful for venues that don't have internet but can find an old phone from some time in the last 10 years and a place to plug it in within perhaps 10m of the place where you want to put the monitor.  Phones can use electrical sockets, but one good hiding place is plugged into the back of an internet router using a USB cable. The device sends the data by Bluetooth to the phone for storage and looks easy to set up by installing the app.   The phone doesn't need credit and it will only store data for a year.  If you do this, be careful to get the new model (since February 2024) and to export the data occasionally, and especially before you set the device up for a new location.  The correct model is the 357s, but the manufacturer tells us the following web link will work.  Note that the page does mention the export feature.

A phone can work with more than one Thermopro at a time as long as they are all in range.  We don't know what the actual range will be in practice.


We have volunteers who use cheap electronic parts to make something that can be used either to save the data to pick up or send it to the internet for cloud storage.  They aren't as good as a commercial data logger, especially if you don't have wifi in your building, because they are buggier and harder to use.  If you have wifi, any pain is just at the beginning to get them connected - after that, they usually just work.  Some have been running for over a year but a few groups haven't managed them at all and quite a few have needed phone help from us while they are setting it up.  We're still discovering improvements we can make.  If you'd like to try one, let us know.  They are currently free but in future we may suggest you make a donation to cover the cost of parts and postage.

We just use the word "thermal monitor" to mean either what our volunteers build or a commercial data logger because people find the term less puzzling.
