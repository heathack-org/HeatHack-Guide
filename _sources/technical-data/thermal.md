# Temperature and relative humidity readings


Regular temperature readings are very useful for understanding where you are wasting energy on heating.  Monitoring often indicates that a small change in practice or a small investment in different heating controls will save enough money to be worth the bother.  In buildings that are slow to warm up and not used all the time, it's common to discover a quarter of the heating is wasted, and we have sometimes found much bigger problems, like a church hall that had accidentally been heated 24/7 for years.  Monitoring will also help you understand and handle user complaints and know when maintenance is required.

Your heating controls might already log room temperature for you.

Relative humidity readings are also useful if you have any concerns about damp or dryness in your building.  That might be because you want to be sure the conditions are right for people, or it might be because you want to safeguard the building or its contents.  This is less important than recording temperature because if it's too damp or too dry for the people in the building, it should be obvious.  However, if you are a church with a pipe organ or other sensitive furnishings, or a building with unfrequented spaces that you think might be damp, it's useful to have a device capable of monitoring relative humidity (RH) so you can use it for this some of the time.  It's difficult to measure relative humidity accurately so you should treat the readings as approximate.

If you have the money, you can get a commercial "data logger".  These are usually USB sticks and are easy to use with free software provided.  The cheaper options don't send data to the internet.  Instead, you have to pick up the data using the software on a computer.   There are several companies that make them.  It costs around £45 to get a commercial temperature logger, £65 to get one that logs temperature and relative humidity, and £140 to get one that sends data to the internet for cloud storage.    
Devices from less established companies might be cheaper, but it's possible you get what you pay for - we aren't sure.  Lascar Easylog USB is a common choice so you could compare your options to those.

We have volunteers who use cheap electronic parts to make something that can be used either to save the data to pick up or send it to the internet for cloud storage.  They aren't as good as a commercial data logger, especially if you don't have wifi in your building, because they are buggier and harder to use.  If you have wifi, any pain is just at the beginning to get them connected - after that, they usually just work.  Some have been running for over a year but a few groups haven't managed them at all and quite a few have needed phone help from us while they are setting it up.  We're still discovering improvements we can make.  If you'd like to try one, let us know.  They are currently free but in future we may suggest you make a donation to cover the cost of parts and postage.

We just use the word "thermal monitor" to mean either what our volunteers build or a commercial data logger because people find the term less puzzling.


```{admonition} A new option we are testing

We haven't tried this, but there is a relatively cheap device that sounds useful for venues that don't have internet but can find an old phone and a place to plug it in within perhaps 10m of the place where you want to put the monitor.    If you do this, be careful to get the new model (since February 2024) and to export the data occasionally, especially before you set the device up for a new location.  It will only store data for a year.  The correct model is the 357s, but the manufacturer tells us the following web link will work.  Note that the page does mention the export feature.

- [Thermopro TP357s, labelled as TP357, but correct product at 17 April 2024](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B093PT1NL1?ref=myi_title_dp&th=1)

A phone can work with more than one Thermopro at a time as long as they are all in range.  We don't know what the actual range will be in practice and the batteries won't last well because the product is really designed for keeping an eye on things like nurseries and greenhouses where you might need to act quickly.   If you don't have a handy electric socket, consider plugging the device into the back of an internet router or computer using a USB cable.  Many USB sockets supply power and this is a good way of hiding the device so that no one unplugs it.   

It looks like any Android or Apple phone bought since around 2016 should work for this.  It doesn't need security updates but do ensure the phone can't be used to access any of your personal information or finances, for instance, by making sure it's protected with a secure PIN or biometrics, or deleting apps and registering it to a new email address.  You can turn wifi off.  Take the SIM out in case you've made it possible to reset any of your accounts from its phone number.
