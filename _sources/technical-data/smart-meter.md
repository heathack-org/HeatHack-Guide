# Smart meters

Smart meters are free, including the cost of installation, unless the installer identifies unsafe conditions on "your" side of the meter.  That's unlikely, but if they do, you want that fixed! They send your readings to your utility company every 30 minutes. We expect future energy efficiency consultants to want the full data.   Combining it with heating performance data and historical weather data will let them use "degree days" to understand whether your heating is under good control. 


```{admonition} Do smart meters work?

The early "SMETS1" meters always worked as meters, but they often failed to be "smart" and send regular readings to the utility company.  Usually this was because they couldn't cope with changing suppliers and didn't work in high rise flats, but sometimes they couldn't reach the mobile phone network.  The current "SMETS2" meters can change suppliers and use a better network.  Installers can now test the network signal at the meters before they start work so they can spot problems ahead and tell you your options.

You can request smart meters from your utility company instead of waiting for them to offer one.   They might refuse you, but they will tell you why.  Usually it's because they know the meter won't be able to communicate with them, your supply is complicated, or your meter is unusual, for instance, in supporting different tariffs for day and night.   You need to have sufficient space around the meter for the installer to make changes, and that can be an issue if you've hidden the meter inside a fancy cabinet.  

All energy suppliers will make it easy to see from your smart meter how much energy you are currently using by providing you with a display you can place somewhere convenient.  Some suppliers give access to graphs and statistics based on the data, and still others give access to data itself.   If the supplier doesn't, you should be able to get the data using a third party app.  This is harder for community groups than for householders because usually the apps have you prove that it's your meter by verifying a bank account or credit card registered to the same address as the meter.  You may need to talk to your bank and the app company about how to supply the required proof.

```{admonition} A good use for "In Home" Displays 
:class: tip

Suppliers of smart electricity meters are required to give you a display that will show your current electricity use.  You can place these anywhere in the building that is within radio range of the meter.

We suggest you see whether it's possible to mount the display at your main exit.  You can use past overnight readings to find out your "base load" - the amount of electricity your building uses when it is empty.  You can then have those who lock up your buildings check the current usage before they leave. If the current usage is higher than expected even allowing for intermittent demand from things like refrigerators, then something has been left on.
