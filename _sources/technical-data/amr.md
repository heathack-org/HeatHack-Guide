# Automatic meter reading services

Some community groups with more complex premises or who can't manage to verify which meter they own use an **automatic meter reading (AMR)** service instead of getting a smart meter.
With these, someone besides your utility company provides your meter.   AMR services always provide the customer with the full energy data and they have more interest in getting your metering right.  They can also include submetering - useful if you have several buildings served by the same supply.  

We've been told that the service is not expensive.
