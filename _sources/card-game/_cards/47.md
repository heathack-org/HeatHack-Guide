**Turn sunshine into electricity**

Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels generate electricity for immediate use, battery storage, or sale to the grid and are becoming more acceptable even on listed buildings.   There are ground mounted solar panels for those with enough space.   If finance is an issue for you, a solar cooperative might be willing to take your site on. Be cautious about your roof if it is weak, high up, or has lots of obstacles, and check the payback for your situation.  Also make sure to think about any impacts on rainwater clearance.
