**Reduce the hot water temperature**


If you have hot water “on demand” from a combi-boiler or point-of-service hot water heater, you can set it for what feels right at  the taps.  50C is a good starting point.   If you store your hot water, be careful.  Cylinders and tanks need to be regularly raised to 60C to deter Legionella bacteria.  This usually means setting your boiler thermostat at 70C and blending with cold water at the taps.
