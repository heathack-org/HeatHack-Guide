**Update your lighting**

Fluorescent lamps are being phased out imminently in favour of LEDs.  Also think about any  high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, as LEDs would use 40-75% of the power and look better.  When you make a change, think about whether your lights are the right power in the right places, and also look at the energy efficiency of the LEDs you put in. New generation LEDs are more expensive, but take half the power of the cheapest ones.
