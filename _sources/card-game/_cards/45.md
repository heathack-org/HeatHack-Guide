**Add or switch to radiant heating**

If you canâ€™t keep warm air in your building, you could install radiant heaters.  They act like mini suns for use just when people are in, providing heat directly to the people.  Some buildings only have radiant heating.  Others heat the air a little too.   You'll need your heating carefully designed to suit your space, and if you have lots of furniture, you'll want it high up, maybe as chandeliers or ceiling panels.  Not all radiant heaters glow. They can be very discrete.
