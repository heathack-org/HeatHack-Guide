**Update your boiler controls**

Modern energy efficiency controls are relatively inexpensive and effective.  If you are heating a leaky building for specific events, you probably want “optimised start control”.  This learns when to turn the heating to get the building warm on time. If you heat an insulated building most of the time, “weather compensation” will make the whole system run cooler when it’s warm out.  If your spaces warm quickly, “load compensation” will slow the heating down as it reaches temperature so it won’t overshoot.
