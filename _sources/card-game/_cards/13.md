**Control your fan convectors**

Fan convectors can make people uncomfortable if the fan is set too high.  They usually have controls that let you reduce the fan speed to slow them down when the space is almost warm enough.  Then the room temperature changes less and more gently while people are in.  To find the controls, you may need to take the cover off.  While you are right there, make sure you clean the filter!
