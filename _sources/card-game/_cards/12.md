**Check your thermostat and its location**

Many community buildings have thermostats or temperature sensors that are useless because they are broken, on a very cold wall, no longer wired in, or don’t get air past them. If the batteries in a wireless model go flat, that could bring your heating on when you aren’t expecting it.  If your space ever overheats, you’ll definitely want to check these things.  Consider updating old “analogue” models to digital ones so the temperature will vary less, making people more comfortable.
