**Draughtproof the building**

Draughts let cold air in and make people very uncomfortable. Draughtproofing leaky windows is expensive, but important.  Also think about doors, loft hatches, floors, skirting boards, and the holes created to fit in things like heating pipes and extractor fans.  Don't block up deliberate ventilation like wall and floor vents without taking advice, and keep a little air flow through chimneys  against damp.   Some draught-proofing  can be done as DIY but professionals can often get better materials.
