**Improve or install extractor fans**

Extractor fans remove moist or stale air, but they also cause heat loss unless you get a special kind that recovers the heat and keeps it in the building.  This is worth the added cost for fans that are often on. Also think about whether your extractor fans run for too long.  Extractor fans can come on and go off with the lights, come on with the lights but run longer, have their own switch, or run only when the air is moist. The right choice depends on the application.
