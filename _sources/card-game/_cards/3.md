**Provide maintenance contact details**

When users don’t know who to contact, they take things into their own hands. That may mean bringing in space heaters, turning on the oven and hob to warm the space, and blocking exits open with fire extinguishers. You need to know what problems they’re having and work with them to find out what's going wrong. If you have occasional or loosely managed user groups in, you may need signage with contact details.
