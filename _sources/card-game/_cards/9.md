**Restrict the heating changes users can make**

Only let your users make themselves more comfortable without affecting other groups.  Good controls for our buildings will lock the advanced settings so users can only turn the heating up and down for a short time or until the next scheduled heating change.  At least use limiting pins so they can’t turn thermostats and thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) all the way up or down and leave them that way, and don’t let them make extreme changes like turning the heating all the way up or down.
