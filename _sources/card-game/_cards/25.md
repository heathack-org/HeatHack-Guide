**Reduce the size of heated spaces**

Many community buildings have high ceilings.  Putting in a false ceiling can substantially reduce the amount of heating you need and give you a way of insulating a difficult roof.   Similarly, if your spaces are too large for your user groups, partitioning them might reduce your heating bills or increase your income.  Architects tell us community groups often fail to think carefully enough about making these and other changes to their buildings.
