# Flow restricting tap aerators

A flow restricting tap aerator will make water come out of a tap less quickly.  They are sometimes called "flow regulators".  This is a good "net zero" action because it saves water.  You can judge the flow rate for a tap by filling a bucket for one minute and measuring how many litres the bucket contains.  The aerator will specify its flow rate, letting you calculate how much water it will save, typically up to 35%.  Most people fit the aerators themselves.

If your users go through a lot of hot water, this could action could also save energy on your premises.  We haven't included it because the prices for aerators and the amount of hot water used vary so much that it's hard to guess about whether the action pays back.  They also have to be cleaned regularly and might not last long, especially in hard water areas.
