# Switch to a biomass boiler

Biomass boilers burn organic matter instead of fossil fuels.  They are considered to be carbon neutral because when the biomass grows it takes carbon out of the atmosphere that balances out what is released when the material is burned.  

Burning biomass creates air pollution so it is only allowed in rural areas.   Many green activists dislike biomass because of the pollution but also because the boilers are mostly run on wood pellets grown in Canada specifically for burning instead of on waste material.

The UK aspires eventually to phase biomass out for buildings and just use it in power stations.  This is so they can scrub the emissions and use carbon capture and storage to make it a lower carbon technology.  That creates some uncertainty about the future for this boilers.  However, 
if you are in a rural area, have an oil-fired boiler that will need replaced soon, and there's some reason why you really can't switch to some form of electrically-powered heating, this may be your best option.
