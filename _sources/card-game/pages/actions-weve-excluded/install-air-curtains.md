# Install air curtains

n air curtain is a fan-powered device that blows a jet of warm or room  temperature air over an open doorway.  It blocks cold air on one side from moving into a heated space. They have to be powerful and the full width of the door to work. They usually let you vary the air temperature and fan speed so you can find the lowest settings that will work.  Air curtains struggle with wind, so theyâ€™re better on inner doors of vestibules than on external ones.  Some places have to keep doors wide open, but in community buildings, this would be an expensive way to block cold air compared to a draught lobby or doors that close automatically.

Some community groups think they have air curtains, but they really just have over-door fan convectors that provide direct warmth to anyone standing in the doorway.  These won't keep cold air from exiting the building.  

Air curtains are meant for buildings like shops and warehouses that are so busy they are forced to leave a door open most of the time.   In our buildings, where people need to be able to enter "hands-free", automatic doors are a better option.
