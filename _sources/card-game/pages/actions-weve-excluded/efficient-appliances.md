# Switch to more efficient appliances 

There is a carbon cost associated with making anything new.  This is called "embodied carbon".   If you include the embodied carbon in your thinking, it's rare for replacing anything to pay back in carbon terms.  The best strategy is usually to wait until something is about to wear out before replacing it, and even then, many green activists buy used items wherever possible.  

If you do need to replace an appliance, consider the energy efficiency ratings of your options and whether you will be able to repair or recycle them in future.

Lots of refrigerators, freezers, and ovens could do with having their door seals replaced.   If you think your appliances are wasting energy, this is a good thing to check.  We just didn't want to include too many cards.
