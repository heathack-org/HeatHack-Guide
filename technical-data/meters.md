# Energy meter readings

We know that community venues struggle to collect energy meter readings, but without them, consultants can't provide good advice.  Regular meter readings will also help you spot when you start to waste energy accidentally, understand the costs associated with room hires,  and calculate the payback of energy efficiency measures. 

This is why we highly recommend getting **both** gas and electricity smart meters, but we do give some other strategies for getting meter readings.
