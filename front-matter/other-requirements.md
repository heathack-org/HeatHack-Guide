# Other requirements

Beyond having a group leader who will run the sessions, and preferably an engineer who will assist:

- You must tell us specific dates when you expect to run sessions.  Otherwise there's too much risk that we will waste our funds and volunteer time by sending you a thermal monitor and card game that you won't use.  Setting dates is the thing groups find hardest about the whole programme.  We prefer you to schedule all sessions from the beginning.  

- The group leader should fill out a very brief session report after each session telling us things like how many people were there and what you need from us.   

    - [Group leaders' session report form](https://forms.gle/GTMfrL31W8RY3FY17)


- You must ask any other group members that are willing to fill in a brief survey.  Not every group member has to fill it in, but we're very grateful for the feedback.

    - [Evaluation Survey](https://forms.gle/wfK7AXNWRKrrJfQw5)

    We remind you about this in the session schedules.

- We may ask for a brief interview to understand how the programme was for you and what the impact was for your organisation, so we can improve the programme and attract new funding.

````{admonition} Royal Academy of Engineering programme participants

These groups get priority attention from us, and the chance to claim expenses, but they must have a participating engineer.  Additionally:

- The engineer must agree to fill in a brief Royal Academy of Engineering form at the beginning of the programme and again sometime after the end, probably in September 2024. The link for this will be sent by email. It’s not to evaluate whether the engineer is suitable! It’s about their experience of the programme and whether it was good for them.

- You must give us the full postcodes of the people in the group who are willing to share this information, apart from the engineer who is helping to lead it.  You will be reminded to do this in session 1. We throw the postcodes into a big list and send them to the Royal Academy of Engineering.  They throw them into an even bigger list and use it to check whether their programmes only reach people who are well-off, a problem for many kinds of programmes that they worry about.  No one will use the postcodes for any other purpose.

- You must ask for a volunteer from your group to participate in a 5-10 minute interview with an independent third party who is evaluating our programme.  We remind you to do this during the third session.
