# Who we are

 HeatHack is a group of community volunteers that helps churches and other community groups understand how to heat their buildings better.    We started in and around Edinburgh in Scotland with groups that were cold but had high gas bills.   We understand the things community groups find difficult because that's where we come from - we had to learn everything from scratch to do our work.  We have always combined a bit of technology for temperature monitoring with engineering and a lot of thinking about what people actually do when they are in buildings.

Our current programme has been developed and is being run in conjunction with The Surefoot Effect, a Community Interest Company.

Since 2012, Surefoot has been helping communities, businesses and governments put carbon reduction and care for the environment at the heart of strategy.  We work at every level, locally, nationally and internationally to support the essential paradigm shift needed to protect people and the planet. Our continued success lies in the values-based, people and process-led approaches we use and tailor to each project.

We also have support from Engineers without Borders UK to help find engineers for community groups who cannot find them for themselves.

Engineers Without Borders UK is working to reach the tipping point to ensure a safe and just future for all. Part of a global movement of over 60 Engineers Without Borders organisations, we inspire, upskill and drive change in the engineering community and together take action to put global responsibility at the heart of engineering.

The programme would not be possible without the generous support of the Royal Academy of Engineering through their Ingenious public engagement programme.

HeatHack has previously been funded by the John Templeton Foundation via Scientists in Congregations Scotland, with small contributions from the University of Edinburgh Schools of Informatics and Engineering and the University of St Andrews School of Computer Science and with the help of engineering, computer science, and design students.  The University of St Andrews Entrepreneurship programme is currently helping us think about how to sustain what we do financially.
