# Contacting us 

We'd like everyone using our materials to register with us.  We don't have them behind a password because we know that puts people off and keeps them from finding us - but it also makes it harder to convince funders that what we do is worthwhile.  

- [Register with us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWTFzZ4aeC2aI87go2bGpZGaPZMJkseS0lhXhjRAQLVk7v8w/viewform?usp=header)

We are very happy to get feedback - good and bad! - and also be told what support you need.  We can't always provide it, but sometimes we know people who can, and it helps us know what to do next.

You can of course also contact us by traditional means.  We prioritise dealing with requests from groups participating in funded programmes and that are helping us in this way, but we try to help everyone and when requests get too much, we intend to set up "office hours" and other ways of dealing with the demand.
