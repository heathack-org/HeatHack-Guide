# Contacting us 

We are happy for you to tell us anything you think we should know, or ask us questions, at any time.  If you have feedback about the sessions and want to help us improve the programme, the easiest way is to fill in a feedback form:

- [Leader and Engineer Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelF7T0pEaX2-UD-kBIGJ9_AKjKSBzyn9gKfhPW7MJgZEvSzQ/viewform)

If you need us to fix something urgently, you can email us or phone.

- [Start an email to us](mailto:director@heathack.org)
- Phone number as on emails from us

The people who contact us the most get the best service from us, and have the biggest impact on how we improve the programme.  We're small, but we do the very best we can to help and to signpost you to others who can help, too.
