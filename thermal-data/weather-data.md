# Weather data

It matters what the weather conditions were like outside when you took your temperature readings.  The gold standard is to put a waterproof monitor outside, but a good "second best" approach is to check the historical weather record at the closest weather station you can find.  You might find this useful for thinking about your temperature data.

Engineers and professionals may wish to plot internal against hourly external temperature, or use daily data to conduct a formal analysis of your heating controls and building's heat loss.  They use weather data more like this.
